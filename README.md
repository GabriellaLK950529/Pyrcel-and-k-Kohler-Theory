Pyrcel documentation
Using the pyrcel documentation to model the relationship between fog microphysics and CCN concentrations in coastal-arid environements.
Fog microphysical data was measured from and Fog Monitor (FM-100)
CCN concentrations were calculated using multiple instruments (HTDMA, DMA)- data was assimilated from a Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (CCNC) 
Fog events were observed in conjunction with visibility and the influence of meteorological parameters. 
Two primary fog events which occured on 09 and 10 September 2017, comprised of increased particle concentration and visibility of <100 m (dense fog).
The aim of using the pyrcel documetation is to determine the supersaturtion ratios and hygrcoscopicity of aerosol particles - 
correlated to the k-KÃ¶hler  theory thus identifying the single value for hygroscopic parameter, k
